          In this project, my role was to convert Java Swings and applets into
          Angular, bringing modernization and enhanced functionality to the
          existing application. This involved understanding the legacy Java
          codebase, analyzing the requirements, and implementing the necessary
          changes to migrate the application to the Angular framework.
